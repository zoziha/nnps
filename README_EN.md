# quad-tree

The quadtree model has great applications in collision detection.

In the particle method fluid mechanics, the time complexity of $o(N\lg{N})$ will make the particle search very efficient and robust.

The quadtree is also the basis of the octree, and it is expected that support for the octree will be added in the follow-up work.
